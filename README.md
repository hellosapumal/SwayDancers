## 🏁 Getting Started

Since this project uses the Tailwind CSS CDN, there is no build step required for development.

1. **Clone the repository** (if using Git):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sway-dancers.git
   ```
2. **Open the project**:
   - Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
   - Or serve it using a local server like Live Server for VS Code.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **Typography**: Bold `Bebas Neue` headings capture the energy of dance, while `Inter` ensures readability for content.
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Background: Black (`#0B0B0B`)
  - Accent: Red (`#E10600`)
  - Text: White/Grey (`#F5F5F5`, `#9B9B9B`)
